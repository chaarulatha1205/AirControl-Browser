# AirControl-Browser
🚀 Gesture-Based Web Automation System
📌 Overview

This project presents a real-time gesture-controlled web automation system that replaces traditional mouse and keyboard interactions with computer vision-based hand gestures. Using live video input, the system detects, interprets, and maps hand gestures to browser actions, enabling a completely touchless web interaction experience.

The solution integrates robust gesture validation, dual-hand contextual intelligence, and a gesture-based security layer to ensure accurate, secure, and low-latency performance in real-world environments.

✨ Key Features

Dual-Hand Contextual Recognition
Differentiates between left and right hands, allowing identical gestures to perform different actions and increasing command flexibility without adding complexity.

Temporal Gesture Validation
Implements time-based confirmation logic to eliminate accidental triggers and improve system stability.

Gesture-Driven Security Layer
Includes an admin-controlled reset mechanism and controlled gesture access to prevent unauthorized usage.

Real-Time Processing Pipeline
Optimized frame processing ensures smooth and responsive browser automation with minimal latency.

Touchless Web Automation
Enables scrolling, clicking, navigation, and other browser interactions using natural hand movements.
